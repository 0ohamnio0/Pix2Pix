This is a [pix2pix] (image-to-image translation with deep neural network)
implementation on Unity.

This implementation supports the weight data format used in Christopher Hesse's
[interactive demo]. Pick one of the [pre-trained models], or you can train your
own model with using [pix2pix-tensorflow].
